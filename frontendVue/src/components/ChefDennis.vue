                Internationally renowned, multi-Michelin starred chef Denis Križak has opened a string of successful
                restaurants across the globe, from the Croatia and France to Singapore and the United States. Denis has
                also become a star of the small screen both in the Croatia and internationally, with shows such as Krim
                team, DMD Damn Delicious and many more.

                Croatian by birth, chef Denis Križak was brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, and
                initially aspired to be a professional footballer. However, when an injury prematurely put an end to any
                hopes of a promising career on the pitch, Denis went back to college to complete a course in hotel
                management.
